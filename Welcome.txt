Welcome! I'm KjAnimates! I made this site to try to re-create the experience I had playing the original Cookie Clicker. It's really fun! The problem with this though, is
you can't save. So if you have 30,000 cookies clicked, and you leave, it won't save. I'm working on it, though. This is a recreation of the original cookie clicker.
So go check that out as well. I do not take full credit for the idea.
